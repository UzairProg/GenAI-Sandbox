# Hugging Face - Github of LLMs (Machine Learning Models)

- if you are fine tuning a model, you can upload it to hugging face and share it with the community
- you can also use models shared by others in your applications
- hugging face provides a hub for models, datasets, and spaces (apps).. spaces are like web apps that run ML models

- hugging face also offers tools like transformers library to easily work with these models.. means you can load pre-trained models and use them for various tasks with just a few lines of code

- hugging face has a large collection of pre-trained models for various tasks like text generation, classification, translation, etc.
- you can search for models based on tasks, languages, and frameworks
- hugging face also provides an inference API to use models without downloading them
- you can create an account on hugging face to manage your models and datasets
- hugging face has a vibrant community where you can discuss and collaborate on machine learning projects
  - suggest improvements
    - report issues
    - contribute code
- hugging face also offers courses and tutorials to help you learn about machine learning and NLP
- overall, hugging face is a valuable resource for anyone working with machine learning models, especially in
natural language processing
